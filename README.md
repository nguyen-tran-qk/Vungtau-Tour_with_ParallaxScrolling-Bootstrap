# Vungtau Tour with Parallax Scrolling and Bootstrap
A responsive one-page website to welcome travelers to my hometown – Vungtau city with future potential of providing booking for tours, hotel rooms, restaurants…

I use Brackets to build this web. It applies Simple Parallax Scrolling Effect on [callmenick.com](http://callmenick.com/post/simple-parallax-scrolling-effect), [scrollTo.js] (https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo)
and some Bootstrap.
